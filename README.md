# ðŸ§  NLP with Transformers â€“ Code Implementations

This repository contains my personal code implementations and experiments based on the book **[Natural Language Processing with Transformers (2nd Edition)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/)** by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf (published by Oâ€™Reilly Media and Hugging Face).

## ðŸ“š About the Book

The book provides a hands-on, project-driven approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using state-of-the-art Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, GPT, T5, and more. It covers:
- Preprocessing text for Transformers
- Fine-tuning models for classification, summarization, and question answering
- Building pipelines and production-ready tools
- Interpretability and fairness in NLP
- Deployment with Hugging Face ðŸ¤— ecosystem
